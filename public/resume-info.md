# Resume Setup Instructions

To complete the Resume section setup, you need to add the following files to the `public` folder:

## Required Files:

1. **resume.pdf** - Your actual resume in PDF format
   - Place your resume PDF file in `/public/resume.pdf`
   - This will be used for both viewing and downloading

2. **resume-preview.jpg** - A preview image of your resume
   - Create a screenshot or image of your resume first page
   - Save it as `/public/resume-preview.jpg`
   - Recommended size: 400x500 pixels or similar aspect ratio

## Current Status:
- ✅ Resume component created and integrated
- ⚠️ Resume PDF file needed
- ⚠️ Resume preview image needed

## Fallback:
If the files are not found, the component will show placeholder images and still allow users to attempt downloads.

## To Update:
1. Add your resume.pdf to the public folder
2. Add your resume-preview.jpg to the public folder
3. The component will automatically use these files
