EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password

# SMTP Settings (Gmail)
# Server: smtp.gmail.com
# Port: 587
# Encryption: STARTTLS
```

## Security Features

- Rate limiting: 5 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- Input validation for all form fields
- Email format validation
- Message length validation (minimum 10 characters)
- Secure SMTP connection with STARTTLS

## Troubleshooting

2. **Connection Issues**:
   - Verify your internet connection
   - Check if port 587 is not blocked by your firewall
   - Ensure you're using the correct SMTP settings

3. **Rate Limiting**:
